- re-enable mouse support
- make dialog boxes full screen with high z-index in a transparent layer as per the SDK in order to remove ability to focus on things behind the dialog box:
<div style="width:1680px;height:559px;color:#FFF;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;z-index:987;"><iframe width="1680px" height="559px" id="iframe0.23153966083191335" src="file:///C:/Users/yehoshua/Documents/clients/transgaming/galapago/sdk/media/promo/kula-blox.html" style="pointer-events: none;"></iframe></div>
<div style="width:1680px;height:559px;color:rgba(255,0,0,0);position:absolute;top:0;left:0;z-index:988;"></div>
- minimize canvas size for danger bar
- minimize canvas for grid
- separate canvas for powerups
- separate canvas for collection key
- separate canvas for end of level animation
- modularize end of game optimization to anticipate making it optional for different hardware
- evaluate merging gridLayer, creatureLayer, and goldLayer into one canvas to save memory (and take a possible slight performance hit)
- either combine map canvas with main game canvas and repurpose based on which screen is displayed, or create and destroy canvas based on which screen is displayed
